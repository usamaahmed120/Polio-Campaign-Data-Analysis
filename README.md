## Polio Campaign Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script developed to analyze and validate data from Polio Campaigns. The script aims to automate the process, making it more efficient and accurate. It leverages the Pandas and OS libraries to handle data processing and file management.

### Features

- Analyzes the Form2A file, which provides a summary of daily activities by Area Supervisors during the campaign.
- Validates the Form2A data based on company instructions and identifies any discrepancies.
- Matches the Form2A information with the LineList, ZeroDose, and AFP files, ensuring the correct number of entries.
- Provides detailed information on Still Missed Children (SMC), ZeroDose, and Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) cases.
- Improves data analysis efficiency and reduces the chances of manual errors.

### Usage

1. Ensure Python and the required dependencies (Pandas, OS) are installed.
2. Place the Form2A file in the **input** directory.
3. Optionally, place the LineList, ZeroDose, and AFP files in the **input** directory as well.
4. Run the script, providing the Form2A file path as an argument.
5. Optionally, provide additional files (LineList, ZeroDose, and AFP) to enable data matching and validation.
6. The script will validate the data and provide insights on any discrepancies or issues encountered.
7. The resulting analysis and validation reports will be stored in the **output** directory.

### Directory Structure

- **input**: Contains the input files (Form2A, LineList, ZeroDose, AFP).
- **output**: Stores the analysis and validation reports generated by the script.
